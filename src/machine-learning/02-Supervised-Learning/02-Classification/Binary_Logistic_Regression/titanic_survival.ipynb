Coordinate descent is based on minimizing a multivariate function by solving univariate optimization problems in a loop. In other words, it moves toward the minimum in one direction at a time. It is the default solver for Scikit-learn versions earlier than 0.22.0. It performs pretty well with high dimensionality. It does have a number of drawbacks. It can get stuck, is unable to run in parallel, and can only solve multi-class logistic regression with one-vs.-rest.\n","\n","sag — Stochastic Average Gradient descent. A variation of gradient descent and incremental aggregated gradient approaches that uses a random sample of previous gradient values.
