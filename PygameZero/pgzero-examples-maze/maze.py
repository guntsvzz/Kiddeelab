"""Game to solve a randomly generated maze.

Ideas for improvement:

* Change maze colour every game
* Randomize the position of the start and goal.
* Add more collectibles, eg. coins.
* Count the number of moves.
* Generate more interesting mazes by biasing the algorithm. Instead of
  `random.choice()`, try a weighted random choice, perhaps with higher weight
  for horizontal moves, or going "straight ahead".

    We use a simple maze generation algorithm that fills all squares in the
    grid, visiting each one once. When we have a choice of where to go next,
    we pick at random. If we have no choices, we backtrack to where we last
    had a choice, and if we still have a choice, we pick a different choice.

    This algorithm is guaranteed to provide a route from the start point to
    all points in the grid.

    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm for more on
    maze generation.

    We store the available moves as a set of edges. If `frozenset([a, b])`
    is in `edges`, then there is a route between a and b.

    Seperately, we compute a list of lines to draw, based on the edges that
    are *not* available. We add a line in each such case. Calculating the
    lines to draw one time after the maze is generated makes the game run
    faster than doing the same operation every frame.
