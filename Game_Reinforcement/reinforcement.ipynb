    "## Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback on its actions and experiences.\n",
    "RL uses rewards and punishment as signals for \"good\" and \"bad\" behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, at each step, the agent outputs an action, which is input to the environment. The environment evolves according to its dynamics, the agent observes the new state of the environment\n",
    "and (optionally) a reward, and the process continues until hopefully the agent learns what behavior maximizes its reward.\n",
